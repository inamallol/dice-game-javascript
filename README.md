*DICE GAME*

It's a multiplayer dice game for 2 players

Each player has its turn. The shadow below the numbers indicates whose turn it is. 
When a player rolls the dice the app throws a random number between 1 and 6 and add it to the score of that player.

If the player want to make a riskier move he can choose for "Double or Nothing". The app will randomly throw 0 or double the number that the dice gives. 

The first player to get 20 points is the WINNER! 

LET'S PLAY!
